Welcome to my setup showcase !! üòé

I will start from the beginning. 
I developed the interest of building my workspace [not the vscode one] in 2021.
So I started with what was there already in my home. As you can see below a wireless keyboard mouse from HP, this was the first pair of wireless pheripheral my family got me, as I am curious/excited to use new gadgets all the time [and also I get bore with them quickly üòÅ]. So below is my first setup:

/>

This setup taught me web development, made me a wordpress developer and a Tutor. I also learned React.js. and also if you want to know what this setup consist I will list the items now.

### Setup 1
1. Old Computer Desk
2. Legion Y540 - Lenovo (i5 9th gen, 1650 nvida, 8GB ram, 256Gb ssd, 1TB hdd, 70 hz)
3. Hp Wireless Keyboard Combo
4. Oneplus z buds
5. Compact Speaker Mi 
6. Diwali Lights 
7. Pen and Notepad

Timeline for setup 1 was mid-graduation till I got my first job. Coming to my first job, I got into Accenture and that was when I started working on my upgradation. Since the job was/is **WORK FROM HOME**.
 I wanted some simple and aesthetic. Started with removing the old computer desk, placed a üê•, to cover the window and rather than buying a new table, I used a wooden board

 here is the setup 2:
