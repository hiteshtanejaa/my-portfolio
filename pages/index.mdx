I'm working on a critical irish financial institute project with Accenture. I am in short edits pythons/PySpark scripts, write SQL queries, open files in Excel do operations on them and also automate manual effort jobs with SSIS packages and scheduling them on Autosys.

In 2022, I started with my first big task in the project which was Anomaly Detection. It gave me a idea of few outlier detecting techniques, and indeed the collective efforts of me and colleagues, anomaly code was born LOL.

Then Slow and gradually, I took the whole responsibility of the Autosys and SSIS Package development, testing and deployment. This taught me how to take ownership and make quick decision when face any job failure.

I also like to share what I learned with my network, I publish articles on Medium and Linkedin, and soon I am thinking to collaborate with people to start with a research paper.
