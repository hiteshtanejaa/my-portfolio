# Hitesh Taneja
AKA. Happy :)

I'm a Data Analyst from India making useful things for the internet and exploring the world's Data.

I'm passionate about using technology to make a positive impact on the world.

I have experience working on a variety of projects, including data analysis, web development, and software engineering. I'm also a regular contributor to Medium, where I write about my experiences and learnings.

In my free time, I beatbox, enjoy traveling, hiking, and spending time with my family and friends and listening to music and now reading self-help books too.
